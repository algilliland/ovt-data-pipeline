# Data Driven Test example directory

This directory serves as a end to end test for the NPN dataset.  
Note that the tests are sensitive to where they are invoked and typically need to be 
run from the application root directory.  

The tests are invoked automatically by the test package
```
{root}/pytest.sh
```

The examples in this directory can also be run outside of this test environment by using:
```
{root}/run_test_npn.sh
```
