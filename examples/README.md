# Examples

The example below follows a single National Phenology Network observation record through the processing pipeline of pre-processing, triplifying, reasoning, and reformatting:

  * [input data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_input.csv): file in its initial format.
  * [pre-processed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_preprocessed.csv): file after it has been run through the pre-processor. 
  * [triplified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_unreasoned.ttl): file after it has been triplified. This file can be opened directly in [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
  * [reasoned](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_reasoned.ttl): file after it has been reasoned on.  This file can be opened directly in [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
  * [reformatted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_reformatted.csv): file after it has been converted to a format for loading into database of choice or viewing with a spreadsheet application.
