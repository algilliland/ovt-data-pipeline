# Examples

Contained in this directory will be examples of triplifying, reasoning, and processing. 

Following is an example of a National Phenology Network record after it has passed through the pipeline processing steps:

  * [input data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_input.csv): file in its initial format.
  * [pre-processed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_preprocessed.csv): file has been run through the pre-processor  
  * [triplified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_unreasoned.ttl): file which has been triplified. This file can be opened directly in [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
  * [reasoned](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_reasoned.ttl): file which has been reasoned.  This file can be opened directly in [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
  * [reformatted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_reformatted.csv): file which has been converted to a format for loading into database of choice or viewing with a spreadsheet application.
