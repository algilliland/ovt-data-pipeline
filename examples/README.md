Contained in this directory will be examples of triplifying, reasoning, and processing. 

Following is an example of a National Phenology Network record after it has passed through the pipeline processing steps:

  * [pre-processed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_preprocessed.csv)  
  * [triplified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_unreasoned.ttl)
  * [reasoned](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_reasoned.ttl)
  * [reformatted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline/master/examples/npn_reformatted.csv)
   
Note that the previous link points to a raw turtle file which can be opened in [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
